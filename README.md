## Archival notice + data validity warning

This project was archived on 23rd May 2022, owing to a limitation in usefulness following changes in UK Government policy:
in short, tests are no longer available for the vast majority of people, and indeed most tests are no longer reportable to the NHS.
This **severely limits** the usefulness of the data supplied, and certainly renders any real data analysis of case numbers or
conclusions drawn from such analysis likely invalid.

Nonetheless, the project remains available in an as-is state.

Thank you!
